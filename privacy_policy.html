            <em>In Short:</em> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.
          </p>

          </ul>

          <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
          <p>
            <em>In Short:</em> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.</strong> We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents ("third parties") who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organization apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct.
          </p>
          <p>
           The third parties we may share personal information with are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul class="mb-4">
            <li><b>Contact form submissions:</b> Formspree</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
          </p>

          <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
          <p>
            <em>In Short:</em> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

          <p>
            We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@brownbox.dev">info@brownbox.dev</a>.

          <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
          <p>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
          </p>

          <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?</h3>

If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
